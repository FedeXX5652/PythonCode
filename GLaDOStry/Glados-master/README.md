## Glados Is Currently Under Maintence (Though This Build Is Still Up). I Am Adding More Stuff Soon, As Well As Cleaning Up Code.

# HOW TO RUN:

If you just want the assistant, run assistant.bat. 

If you want Glados on your desktop then run Glados.bat.

If you want Glados to close out tabs and open nuerotoxin windows, run MortalityCore.bat.


# IMPORTANT:

You must go into config.txt inside of GladOSCode and configure it to your computers needs.

You must have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. 

When installing Python 3.6 it will ask you to install tkinter, please install that as well.

# COMMANDS:

- Try saying hi to Glados. 

- Try asking Glados the weather or date.

- Try asking Glados to do Math. (Dont say any other words when you ask her to do math. For example, only say 2+2.)

- Try asking Glados what she is.

- Try telling Glados goodbye.
